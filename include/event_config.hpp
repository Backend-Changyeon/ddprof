   *  When `Event` is given and is not a valid "normal" event (such as
   *  `sALLOC`) nor a `group:event` tuple, then `Group` is needed to define
   *  the groupname for the tracepoint.
   */

  /*
   *  The Id for the tracepoint.  Customers usually do not know this and will
   *  not specify it; but sometimes debugfs/tracefs may be inaccessible even
   *  though probe points can be consumed through `perf_events`.  This setting
   *  allows users to perform instrumentation in such a configuration.
   */
  kLabel,
  /*
   *  An informative label which is forwarded to the UX, but does not have any
   *  direct relationship with how the watcher calls `perf_event_open()`.  This
   *  may however be used to aggregate watchers in a single ringbuffer (if they
   *  share the same label).
   */
  kMode,
  /*
   *  Specifies what to do with a sample when it is collected.  Comprised of a
   *  string; the presence or absence of certain characters defines the
   *  output mode:
   *    * 'M' or 'm' -- emit a metric
   *    * 'G' or 'g' -- emit a flamegraph (default)
   *    * 'A', 'a', or '*' -- emit all outputs
   */
  kParameter,
  /*
   *  A function parameter number. Is expanded into the correct register for
   *  the System-V procedure call ABI for the current architecture.
   */
  kPeriod,
  /*
   *  Gives the period for which to configure sampling.  Conflicts with
   *  `Frequency`--presence of both is an error.
   */
  kRegister,
  /*
   *  The `perf_event` register number to use for sample normalization.  In a
   *  future patch, the user will be able to use register names.
   */
  kStackSampleSize,
  /*
   *  The `perf_event` setting on stack size. Defines the size of samples that
   * are copied from the user application. This will define how far we can
